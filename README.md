# PGN + Forking Editor

This is a PGN editor that supports creating variations. This allows for better
game analysis since annotators can comment on various different move choices that
could've been made instead of the ones that the players ended up making.

## Some Good Things

- A pure JS PGN editor
- Support for variations
- Yay, it's free on the web

## Some Bad Things

- A pure JS implementation (or my JS code)
